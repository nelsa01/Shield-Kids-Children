Explanation of Key Directories:
* core (or common, shared, utils): This is for code that is not specific to any single feature but can be used by multiple features or throughout the app.
  * network: For your Retrofit service interfaces, API client setup.
  * database: Room database definitions, DAOs, type converters.
  * utils: Generic utility classes/functions (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation, constants).
  * di: (Dependency Injection) If you plan to use Hilt or Koin, this is where your modules would go. For a beginner, you might set this up a bit later, but it's good to have a place for it.
  * base: Base classes like BaseActivity, BaseFragment, BaseViewModel that might contain common boilerplate or functionality you want all your Activities/Fragments/ViewModels to inherit. This is optional but can reduce repetition.
* features:This is the heart of your feature-driven structure. Each distinct capability or section of your app gets its own package.
  * Naming: Use clear, descriptive names for your features (e.g., authentication, dashboard, appmanagement, screentime, safesearch, contentfiltering, geofencing, securitytips).
  * Inside each feature package (e.g., authentication):
    * ui: This is where your UI-related classes go.
    * Activities (e.g., LoginActivity.kt)
    * Fragments (e.g., LoginFragment.kt)
    * ViewModels (e.g., LoginViewModel.kt)
    * Composables (if using Jetpack Compose, e.g., LoginScreen.kt)
    * Adapters (for RecyclerViews, e.g., BlockedAppsAdapter.kt)
    * Dialogs
      *  data (Optional, for more complex features):
      *  Repositories (mediators between data sources and ViewModels).
      *  models (data classes specific to this feature that aren't globally used).
      *  Local or remote data source interfaces/implementations specific to this feature.
      *  service, worker, receiver (As needed):
      *  If a feature involves background work (Services, WorkManager workers, BroadcastReceivers), they can reside directly within the feature package or in a sub-package like service.
